# Dataverse-Data-Analysis

Competed in WiDS/USS Datathon to develop, iterate, and propose a business solution in an interdisciplinary team. Using Python and R, we cleaned, wrangled, and visualize datasets to gain key insights on the given data. Tableau was also used to design an interactive dashboard to better understand and develop a strategy to maximize profitability and sustainiability in the case. 
I performed sensitivity analysis using a logistic regression model, up to an accuracy of 84% within our team.
